# Customer_Amount_Finder
🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Customer Amount Finder! 🎉

This Python application, built using Pandas and Tkinter, allows users to easily upload a CSV file containing customer data and retrieve the amount associated with a specific customer ID.

Key Features:
User -Friendly Interface: Built with Tkinter for a seamless user experience.
CSV File Upload: Easily load customer data from CSV files.
Real-Time Search: Quickly find customer amounts by entering their ID.
